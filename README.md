A simple SAS program to check the license renewal status of our team's real estate agents

This is a SAS program I used to complete a project for my real estate statistics internship. I was provided a spreadsheet with around 100 of our local agents and needed to check which of them have renewed their real estate licenses for the upcoming year. I wrote a simple program in SAS which takes this agent list and two CSV files from the publicly available CT eLicense Lookup tool as inputs. I employed an inner join to match my list of agents to the list of all real estate licenses and some simple data management techniques to output a presentable spreadsheet complete with the status of each of our agents. My manager and I were able to use the result of this program to contact the agents that had not renewed their licenses to remind them of their deadline and to aid them with essential business planning.
